                            First, here's a look at the types of properties listed on
                            Airbnb in San Francisco. As is clear on the graph to the left,
                            Apartments are listed about twice as often as houses,
                            which are in turn listed about twice as often as every other
                            type put together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To look at the graph of everything listed under "other",
                            click <span id="prop-switch" class='switch'>here</span> to swap between the graphs.
                            Most of the listings here are fairly normal, but some like
                            'Lighthouse', 'Treehouse', 'Castle', etc. stand out -
                            but when looking at the actual listings, it doesn't seem like
                            any of them are literal.
                        </p>

        <div id='costs' class='container flex centered'>
            <div class="flex section">
                <h1>Neighborhood Costs</h1>
                <div class='flex'>
                    <div class='vcenter'>
                        <p>
                            Here's the average cost per night per neighborhood.
                            Generally speaking, the northernmost neighborhood are
                            the highest priced per night, but when you start moving
                            away from there, the cost goes down.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the whole city, the average price is
                            <span id='total'></span> per night. Comparing this
                            with the average hotel room price for the city, Airbnb
                            is far cheaper, and usually includes wifi and other
                            various things that hotels tend to charge extra for.
                        </p>

                    <canvas id="neighborhood_costs" width="600px" height="600px"></canvas>

        <div id='ratings' class='container flex centered'>
            <div class="flex section">
                <h1>Neighborhood ratings</h1>
                <div class='flex'>
                    <canvas id="neighborhood_ratings" width="600px" height="600px"></canvas>
                    <div class='vcenter'>
                        <p>
                            Across the board, general ratings are really good.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A lot of analysis could be done on the ratings to
                            find factors that suggest a higher rating. Various
                            amenities, proximity to landmarks, etc. might tell
                            some of the story, and sentiment analysis of the
                            ratings could give the rest of it.
