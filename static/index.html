                            First, here's a look at the types of properties listed on
                            Airbnb in San Francisco. As is clear on the graph to the left,
                            Apartments are listed about twice as often as houses,
                            which are in turn listed about twice as often as every other
                            type put together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To look at the graph of everything listed under "other",
                            click <span id="prop-switch" class='switch'>here</span>  to swap between the graphs.
                            Most of the listings here are fairly normal, but some like
                            'Lighthouse', 'Treehouse', 'Castle', etc. stand out -
                            but when looking at the actual listings, it doesn't seem like
                            any of them are literal.
